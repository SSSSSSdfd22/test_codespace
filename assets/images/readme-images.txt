This folder should contain optimized WebP and fallback JPG images for production.

Placeholders included in HTML reference files; replace with real photos before launch:
- hero.webp / hero.jpg
- before1.webp / before1.jpg
- after1.webp /after1.jpg
- tech-1.jpg / tech-2.jpg

Recommended: compress to WebP, generate responsive sizes, and use `loading="lazy"`.
